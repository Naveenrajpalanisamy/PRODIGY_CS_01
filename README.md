# PRODIGY_CS_01

The code implements a basic Caesar Cipher application using the Tkinter library in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The `encrypt` function shifts letters forward while the `decrypt` function shifts them backward, both handling uppercase and lowercase letters appropriately. Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged. The `encrypt_message` and `decrypt_message` functions handle user input, apply the respective cipher functions and update the GUI with the resulting encrypted or decrypted text. Error handling is included to ensure that the shift value entered by the user is an integer.

The Tkinter GUI consists of labels, entry fields, and buttons arranged in a grid layout. Users can input their message and shift value, then choose to either encrypt or decrypt the message. The result is displayed in an entry field below the buttons. If the user inputs an invalid shift value (not an integer), an error message is shown using `messagebox`. This code demonstrates basic GUI design with Tkinter and introduces fundamental concepts of cryptography and error handling in Python.
